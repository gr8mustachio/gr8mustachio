- 👋 Hi, I’m @gr8mustachio
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a software developer
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Rust, but I know C++, Python, HTML/CSS, SQL, and Java, plus a little bit of JavaScript
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing right now, just doing my own thing trying to get a really solid foundation of computer science
- 📫 How to reach me: nothing right now, but I'll add it in the future
